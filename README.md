Enigma M3 Emulator

This is a MATLAB App for simulating the Enigma encryption machine. It specifically emulates the M3 variant of the machine used during World War II by the German army.

Required Software: MATLAB

To run the app, type the following at the MATLAB command prompt:

launchEnigma

Perform encryption/decryption by clicking on the round keys at the bottom of the machine. Your input and the machines output will be recorded on the tablet on the right of the App. Keyboard input can also be used.

You can configure the machine in a variety of ways. Click the rotor icon on the top-right of the machine to modify the :
- rotor types
- ring offsets of the rotors
- reflector type
- plugboard connections

You can also modify the position of the rotors by hovering over the rotor images and using the scroll-wheel of the mouse or dragging up or down with the left mouse button pressed.

You can also run the simulation completely from the MATLAB command line. See the startHere.m file for a demonstration.
